NI-DAQmx LabVIEW Samples
Release 3 - 2014-09-18


atidaqft-mx.llb	
---------------
atidaqftmx.vi-	
	A single sensor sample that demonstrates loading the calibration file,
	selecting output force and torque units, tool transformations, biasing the
	sensor, and collecting data to file.

Multiple Transducers.vi-
	A multi-sensor sample that demonstrates reading	from multiple DAQ devices,
	loading multiple calibration files, selecting output force and torque units,
	multiple tool transformations, biasing sensors independently, and collecting
	data to file.  Reading from multiple DAQ devices requires that you have the
	DAQ devices synchronized using an RTSI cable.
