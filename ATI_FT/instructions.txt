# Instructions to communicate with the ATI FT Gamma Sensor

1. Connect the serial output from the ATI DAQ black box to a
Serial to USB adaptor cable and then plug in the USB cable to the computer.

2. Open the ati_ft_sensor.py file and scroll to the bottom.

Change the following lines to your needs:

a = AtiFtServer('localhost', 10000, serial_port='COM1', mode='ascii', encrypt_flag=True)
a.listen()

- The first parameter is the IP of the ATI server. If the ATI server will run on the same machine
as the Client the parameter localhost is fine.
- The serial_port is the COM port that the Serial to USB
cable is connected to for Windows is propably 'COM1' to 'COM6' and for Linux "/dev/ttyUSB0".
For Linux use dmesg | grep tty to see where the Gripper is connected to. For windows open the device
manager and go to Ports (COM & LPT) to fing in whice port the Gripper is connected to.
- The mode parameters has to options, ascii and binary for the communication.
The ascii mode works better, the binary mode gives false measurements.
- The encrypt flag is for the SHA-256 encryption between the Server and the Client.
When finished, close the file.

Then open the encryption.py file and replace the following line
in the generate_key function:

password_provided = "root"

with your own password, save the file, exit and run it as:

python3 encryption.py

If there are no errors then there will be a key.key file in the working directory
and the following lines will be shown in the terminal:

hello
encrypted_hello
decrypted_hello

Then run the ati_ft_sensor.py file as:

python3 ati_ft_sensor.py

To communicate with the Server use the following lines:

from ATI_FT.ati_ft_sensor import Client

Send these commands to see the ATI Server options

daq = AtiFtClient('localhost', 10000, encrypt_flag=True)
daq.send('hello')
daq.receive()
daq.send('help')
daq.receive()

To return the message use:
msg = daq.receive(ret=True)

Remember to always start with at the start of every command as:

daq.send('hello')
m = daq.receive(ret=True)
daq.send('forces')
forces_torques = daq.receive(ret=True)
try:
    forces_torques = [float(x) for x in forces_torques.split(',')]
except Exception as e:
    """
    Catch exception where server has not initialized and fixed the correct
    sequence for the ATI FT Sensor and fixing sequence is transmitted.
    """
    print(f'[ATI FT CLIENT]: SERVER NOT INITIALISED \n {e}')
    forces_torques = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
